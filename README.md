# Meal_Delivery_Company_Dashboard
Meal Delivery Company Sales Analytics using Tableau
Problem statement: 

Your client is a meal delivery company that operates in multiple cities. They have various fulfillment centers in these cities for dispatching meal orders to their customers.  

We have the below information with us in the form of 3 different datasets: 

- Weekly_Demand_Data.csv: Historical data of demand for a product-center combination 

- Meal_Info.csv: Meal features such as category and cuisine 

- Fulfilment_center_info.csv: Information for fulfillment centers like center area, city information, etc. 

You need to come up with a dashboard in Tableau that talks about the level of demand in each center type. This analysis needs to be granular enough to include meal information as well. The client wants an end-to-end report to understand which fulfillment areas are doing well and which arenâ€™t.
